title: "DataProf: semantic profiling for iterative data cleansing and business rule acquisition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/sigmod2018
excerpt: 'We showcase the first semantic data profiler, DataProf. For the constraint class of interest, current profilers compute all constraints that hold on the given data set. DataProf also computes perfect sample records that together satisfy the same constraints as the given data set. Such perfect samples make it easier to spot violations of business rules, which experts can cleanse.'
