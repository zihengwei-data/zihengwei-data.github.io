title: "Discovery and Ranking of Embedded Uniqueness Constraints"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/vldb2021eucdis
excerpt: 'We conduct the first study on the discovery of embedded uniqueness constraints (eUCs). These constraints represents unique column combinations embedded in complete fragments of incomplete data. We showcase their implementation as filtered indexes, and their application in integrity management and query optimization. We show that the decision variant of discovering a minimal eUC is NP-complete and W[2]-complete. We characterize the maximum possible solution size, and show which families of eUCs attain that size.'
