title: "Network, popularity and social cohesion: a game-theoretic approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/aaai2017
excerpt: 'We study social cohesion in some special types of graphs and draw a link between social cohesion and a classical notion of structural cohesion by White and Harary. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether a given social network is socially cohesive and show that this problem is CoNP-complete.'
