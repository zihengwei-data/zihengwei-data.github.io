title: "Discovery Algorithms for Embedded Functional Dependencies"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/sigmod2020
excerpt: 'Embedded functional dependencies (eFDs) advance data management applications by data completeness and integrity requirements. We show that the discovery problem of eFDs is NP-complete, W[2]-complete in the output, and has a minimum solution space that is larger than the maximum solution space for functional dependencies. Nevertheless, we use novel data structures and search strategies to develop row-efficient, column-efficient, and hybrid algorithms for eFD discovery.'
