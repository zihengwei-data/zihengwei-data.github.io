title: "Embedded Functional Dependencies and Data-ompleteness Tailored Database Design"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/tods2021
excerpt: 'This paper establishes a principled schema design framework for data with missing values. The framework is based on the new notion of an embedded functional dependency, which is independent of the interpretation of missing values, able to express completeness and integrity requirements on application data, and capable of capturing redundant data value occurrences that may cause problems with processing data that meets the requirements.
