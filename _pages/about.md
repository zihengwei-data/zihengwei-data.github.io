I am currently appointed as a Professor at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. During my tenure at the same university, I served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, focusing on data quality and data mining research. I also joined Huawei Cloud as a Principal Researcher, where I led research in big data management and analytics. I have published over 20 academic papers in prestigious journals and conferences related to data mining and data management, such as TODS, SIGMOD, VLDB J., VLDB, and ICDE. My research primarily revolves around the development of novel theories, scalable algorithms, and intelligent applications to address pressing industrial challenges associated with big data. These challenges include relational data schema design, query acceleration, data quality, data integration, and business intelligence (decision support systems), among others.
