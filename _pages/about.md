I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. I previously worked at the University of Auckland as a Post-doc Research Fellow for data quality and data mining research. I also worked at Huawei Cloud as a principle researcher for big data management and analytics research. I published more 20 academic papers at top venues of data mining and data management including TODS, SIGMOD, VLDB J., VLDB and ICDE. My main research focuses on developing new theories, scalable algorithms and intelligent applications to solve industry-critical problems of big data, such as relational data schema design, query acceleration, data quality, data integration, business intelligence(decision support system) and etc..

I am looking for master(research/professional) and Ph.D. students in Computer Science who are passionate about data. My research group will closely collaborate with leading tech companies and provide various practical research opportunities such as co-supervised projects and internships. If you are interested, feel free to drop your CV to ziheng.wei@whu.edu.cn. You are also welcome to book a meeting with me.
